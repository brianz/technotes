# Postgres

Good article on tuning Postgres on RDS:

## Idle transactions

```sql
SELECT pid, current_timestamp - xact_start AS xact_runtime, state, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'TABLE_NAME'
	AND pid <> pg_backend_pid()
ORDER BY xact_start;
```

## Kill a connection

```sql
select pg_terminate_backend(14429);
```

## Determine what transaction is blocking others

```sql
SELECT blocked_locks.pid     AS blocked_pid,
         blocked_activity.usename  AS blocked_user,
         blocking_locks.pid     AS blocking_pid,
         blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
         blocked_activity.query    AS blocked_statement,
         blocking_activity.query   AS current_statement_in_blocking_process
   FROM  pg_catalog.pg_locks         blocked_locks
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity  ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks         blocking_locks 
        ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
        AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE
        AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
        AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
        AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
        AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
        AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
        AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
        AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
        AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
        AND blocking_locks.pidÂ != blocked_locks.pid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
   WHERE NOT blocked_locks.GRANTED;
```
   
## Analytics around dead tuples

```sql
SELECT relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup, trunc(100*n_dead_tup/(n_live_tup+1))::float "ratio%",
  to_char(last_autovacuum, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as autovacuum_date, 
  to_char(last_autoanalyze, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as autoanalyze_date
FROM pg_stat_all_tables 
ORDER BY last_autovacuum;
```

## Vacuum dead tuples

```sql
VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE) table_name;
```
